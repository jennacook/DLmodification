# DLmodification
A Distribution List (DL) is modified manually, no automation is in place. 

The employees submit the DL modification ticket to request someone be added / removed from a DL and then the DL is updated manually by one of the technical teams. 

Notes:
1. The form relies on the employee entering the DL name. There is nothing to resolve/check that this name is correct.
2. The requestors manager approves this modification. Not the DL owner. 
3. A large number of DLs (mostly on the B2B side) do not have an owner set.
